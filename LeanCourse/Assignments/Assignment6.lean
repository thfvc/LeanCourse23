* From Mathematics in Lean https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean
  Read chapters 9 and 10, all sections

* Do the exercises corresponding to these sections in the `LeanCourse/MIL` folder.
  Feel free to skip exercises if you are confident that you can do them.
  There are solutions in the solution folder in case you get stuck.

# You have two options for this assignment

1. Hand in the solutions to the exercises below. Deadline: 24.11.2023.
2. If you have already chosen a project, and your project doesn't require topology or analysis, you can work on your project. If you do, push a decent amount of work to your fork of the repository by 24.11. In this case you do not have to upload anything on eCampus.

* When you hand in your solution, make sure that the file compiles!
  If you didn't manage to complete a particular exercise, make sure that the proof still compiles,
  by replacing the proof (or part of the proof) by `sorry`.

/- Here is a technical exercise using filters,
that was useful in something I did recently. Useful lemmas here are
* `Filter.Eventually.filter_mono`
* `Filter.Eventually.mono` -/
lemma exercise6_1 {Œπ Œ± : Type*} {p : Œπ ‚Üí Prop} {q : Prop} {a b : Œ±}
    {L : Filter Œπ} {F G : Filter Œ±}
    (hbF : ‚àÄ·∂† x in F, x ‚â† b) (haG : ‚àÄ·∂† x in G, x ‚â† a) (haF : pure a ‚â§ F) (hbG : pure b ‚â§ G) :
    (‚àÄ·∂† i in L, p i ‚Üî q) ‚Üî
    Tendsto (fun i ‚Ü¶ if p i then a else b) L (if q then F else G) := by
  have hab : a ‚â† b

/- To be more concrete, we can use the previous lemma to prove the following.
if we denote the characteristic function of `A` by `1_A`, and `f : ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù` is a function,
then  `f * 1_{s i}` tends to `f * 1_t` iff `x ‚àà s i` eventually means the same as `x ‚àà t` for all `x`. (note that this does *not* necessarily mean that `s i = t` eventually).
Here it lemmas are `indicator_apply` and `apply_ite` -/

In the next three exercises we will show that every continuous injective function `‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù` is
either strictly monotone or strictly antitone.

We start by proving a slightly harder version of the exercise in class.
We generalize the real numbers to an arbitrary type `Œ±`
that satisfies all the conditions required for the intermediate value theorem.
If you want to prove this by using the intermediate value theorem only once,
then use `intermediate_value_uIcc`.
`uIcc a b` is the unordered interval `[min a b, max a b]`.
Useful lemmas: `uIcc_of_le` and `mem_uIcc`. -/
lemma exercise6_3 {f : Œ± ‚Üí Œ±} (hf : Continuous f) (h2f : Injective f) {a b x : Œ±}
    (hab : a ‚â§ b) (h2ab : f a < f b) (hx : a ‚â§ x) : f a ‚â§ f x := by
  sorry

/- Now use this and the intermediate value theorem again
to prove that `f` is at least monotone on `[a, ‚àû)`. -/
lemma exercise6_4 {f : Œ± ‚Üí Œ±} (hf : Continuous f) (h2f : Injective f) {a b : Œ±}
    (hab : a ‚â§ b) (h2ab : f a < f b) : StrictMonoOn f (Ici a) := by
  sorry

Now we can finish just by using the previous exercise multiple times.
In this proof we take advantage that we did the previous exercise for an arbitrary order,
because that allows us to apply it to `‚Ñù` with the reversed order `‚â•`.
This is called `OrderDual ‚Ñù`. This allows us to get that `f` is also strictly monotone on
`(-‚àû, b]`.
Now finish the proof yourself.
You do not need to apply the intermediate value theorem in this exercise.

lemma exercise6_5 (f : ‚Ñù ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (hf : Continuous f) (h2f : Injective f) :
    StrictMono f ‚à® StrictAnti f := by

  ¬∑ intro a b hab h2ab

Let's prove that the absolute value function is not differentiable at 0.
You can do this by showing that the left derivative and the right derivative do exist,
but are not equal. We can state this with `HasDerivWithinAt`
To make the proof go through, we need to show that the intervals have unique derivatives.
An example of a set that doesn't have unique derivatives is the set `‚Ñù √ó {0}`
as a subset of `‚Ñù √ó ‚Ñù`, since that set doesn't contains only points in the `x`-axis,
so within that set there is no way to know what the derivative of a function should be
in the direction of the `y`-axis.

The following lemmas will be useful
* `HasDerivWithinAt.congr`
* `uniqueDiffWithinAt_convex`
* `HasDerivWithinAt.derivWithin`
* `DifferentiableAt.derivWithin`.
