* From Mathematics in Lean https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean
  Read chapters 7 and 8, all sections.

* Do the exercises corresponding to these sections in the `LeanCourse/MIL` folder.
  Feel free to skip exercises if you are confident that you can do them.
  There are solutions in the solution folder in case you get stuck.

* Hand in the solutions to the exercises below. Deadline: 17.11.2023.

* When you hand in your solution, make sure that the file compiles!
  If you didn't manage to complete a particular exercise, make sure that the proof still compiles,
  by replacing the proof (or part of the proof) by `sorry`.

section Ring
variable {R : Type*} [CommRing R]


/- Let's define ourselves what it means to be a unit in a ring and then
  prove that the units of a ring form a group.
  Hint: I recommend that you first prove that the product of two units is again a unit,
  and that you define the inverse of a unit separately using `Exists.choose`.
  Hint 2: to prove associativity, use something like `intros; ext; apply mul_assoc`
  (`rw` doesn't work well because of the casts) -/

Let's prove that the Frobenius morphism is additive, without using that
fact from the library. -/

/- Let's prove that if `M →ₗ[R] M` forms a module over `R`, then `R` must be a commutative ring.
  To prove this we have to additionally assume that `M` contains at least two elements, and
`smul_eq_zero : r • x = 0 ↔ r = 0 ∨ x = 0` (this is given by the `NoZeroSMulDivisors` class).
